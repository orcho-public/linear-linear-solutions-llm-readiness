# Linear Solutions – LLM Readiness Analysis

This repository contains the full analysis of the `Linear Solutions` codebase.

The purpose of this project is to identify places where **documentation, comments, or inline descriptions diverge from actual runtime behavior**, and to explain how those divergences increase the risk of **LLM hallucination** for both human developers and AI coding tools.

All findings in the report are tied to specific file paths and line numbers and can be verified by inspecting the code directly.
